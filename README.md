# hello-world
This first repository contains learning projects for python.
# Later in life
I've come back to coding after decades away and I'm learning python later in life. My first programming language was BASIC and the years later I dabbled in C and C++. My career was never in tech and coding has always simply been an enjoyable thing for me to do.
